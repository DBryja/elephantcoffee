## Overview

### About the website
I've written this website after being highly inspired by a https://www.cafedelmar.nl website.
I really liked the pin effect on the sections which I tried to recreate using GSAP Scrolltrigger.
I managed to create a logo, and redesign hero section. 

## Technical informations

### Built with

**Code**:
- React+Typescript,
- TaiwindCSS,
- GSAP,

**Design**:
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator (used to turn AI Generated png logo to SVG)
- Adobe Photoshop (paste custom made labels onto mockups) 

**Applications used**:
- Visual Studio Code,
- Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator,
- Firefox Developer Edition & Google Chrome dev tools,

## My Process

### Continued Development

There is a lot of things to improve and rework, as I have focused on the desktop view of the website.
  - completely rework the mobile view (really didn't like the outcome)
  - avoid rotating pictures as they may not cover full screen, instead of that import them already in the diagonal persepctive
  - make all animated elements based on classic class-based styling instead of the tailwind approach as classes seem to me easier to maintain using gsap

I also didn't add the shop which I designed from scracth including the e-mail template, as I've decided to make more advanced E-Commerce project in the future, and stay only on the client-side website.
